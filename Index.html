<h1>5-minute quick write - If you were to devote time to a charity, what would it be? How would you help your chosen cause?
</h1>
<p>
I would help homeless people get houses, lots of people help build the houses and then the homeless people can buy the houses for a much cheaper price. I would help with painting and putting down mulch and stuff like that because I canâ€™t actually build a house. I would help around and then when I left I would a: feel like I did something good to help people and b: I would be worn out and ready to go to bed.It might be Habitat for Humanity but I might also do it for another charity.
